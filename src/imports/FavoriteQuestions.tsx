        <p className="mb-0">{`20. A book titled for how a certain novel "bores me so" is excerpted from a collection that begins with this word, edited by Nola Tully. This word is the last to appear in the text, not the title, of a guide by Harry Blamires. This word was called the fourth "cardinal point" of a passage described as "(human, all too human)" in letters to Frank Budgen, by an author who called this the "female word." This word opens a passage in which a man asks for breakfast in bed with eggs at the City Arms hotel, and it also appears before a mention of "how he kissed me under the Moorish Wall" in Gibraltar. This word ends a passage whose lack of punctuation was inspired by Nora Barnacle's letters. That passage ends, "[this word] I said [this word] I will [this word]."

        Quizbowl questions are often themed. Sometimes, it can be a lose theme, but some of the most interesting I've encountered have a well-knit connection between all of their clues. I never expected to write a question on "popular words and phrases originating from William Henry Harrison," but I was reading a book and found several of the clues and knew it had to happen.

        Art is my favorite category to write for because there's so much room to be creative. Dance is a comparatively unexplored category relative to several others in the canon, so I like coming up with creative new answerlines that I think people will know just off being cultured or watching things like classic musicals and films.

        I started editing sets with the Other Academic category, a grab bag for interesting or cross sectional topics. I like to write about how cultural change and interaction over time creates our culture today, like in the words we use. I had read about the Naval traditions with Davy Jones and was intrigued as to what other lore existed - and was very surprised to find a rich history between European, African, and modern sources.

        This question would have been the cinematic last of the Finals match...if it wasn't tied that game. Regardless: I love the whole of Ulysses and the ending has always stuck out to me as one of beauty. More often than not, as I'm searching for one idea (i.e. a question on just Molly Bloom), I found references to make this question happen at the only difficulty it's really possible at: college nationals.
